# Development Roadmap: Modern Retro Portfolio

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

The first phase establishes my development environment and project architecture. I start by creating my Vite project with Svelte and TypeScript, then install essential dependencies like TailwindCSS, testing tools, and development utilities. I organize my project structure following domain-driven design principles, setting up key directories for features, shared code, and routing.

## Phase 2: Core Architecture Implementation

With the foundation in place, I implement the fundamental architecture patterns that will support the entire application. This includes setting up my state management system using Svelte stores, creating base layouts and components, and establishing my theme system. I also implement a content management system for processing markdown files and handling assets.

## Phase 3: Feature Development

I begin building the main features of my portfolio. I start with essential functionality like the theme switcher and navigation components. Then, I develop my content pages—About, Projects, Blog, and Contact sections. Each feature is developed with a mobile-first approach and follows my established design patterns. I ensure proper error handling and loading states throughout.

## Phase 4: Infrastructure and CI/CD

This phase focuses on setting up my deployment pipeline and infrastructure. I establish three environments—development, staging, and production. I configure GitHub Actions for my CI/CD pipeline, implementing automated testing, build processes, and deployment procedures. I also set up monitoring and logging systems to track application health and performance.

## Phase 5: Testing Implementation

Testing is crucial for maintaining code quality. I implement unit tests for core functionality, integration tests for critical user flows, and end-to-end tests for key user journeys. I also set up visual regression testing to ensure themes and layouts remain consistent. This phase includes establishing testing patterns and documentation for future development.

## Phase 6: Documentation

Good documentation ensures maintainability. I create comprehensive documentation covering my architecture decisions, component usage, development workflows, and contribution guidelines. I implement TypeScript documentation for utilities and set up Storybook for component documentation. This includes creating templates for issues and pull requests.

## Phase 7: Performance Optimization

With my core features in place, I focus on optimization. I implement proper code splitting, optimize asset loading, and ensure efficient state management. I set up performance monitoring and establish performance budgets. This phase includes implementing caching strategies and optimizing the build process.

## Phase 8: Enhanced Features

Finally, I implement additional features that enhance the user experience. This includes the Unix-like shell interface for navigation, adding animations and transitions, and implementing any interactive elements. I ensure these features are implemented as progressive enhancements that don't impact core functionality.

## Ongoing Development

After the initial deployment, I continue to:

- Monitor application performance and user behavior
- Implement feedback and bug fixes
- Add new content and features
- Maintain and update dependencies
- Optimize based on real-world usage data
