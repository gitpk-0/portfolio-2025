## Development Pipeline

### Environments

1. Development (dev.kellp.dev)
   - Immediate preview of changes
   - Automated builds on push
2. Staging (staging.kellp.dev)
   - Quality assurance environment
   - Manual promotion from development
3. Production (kellp.dev)
   - Live site
   - Manual promotion from staging

### CI/CD Workflow

1. Code Push → GitHub
2. Automated Tests
3. Build Process
4. Development Deploy
5. Staging Deploy (with approval)

# Future Considerations

## Architecture

### Core Architecture Principles

- Micro-frontend architecture patterns using Svelte components
- Domain-driven design for content organization
- Clean architecture patterns separating concerns:
  - Entities (core business objects)
  - Use Cases (application business rules)
  - Interface Adapters (presenting data)
  - Frameworks/Drivers (external interfaces)

### State Management

- Defined state management strategy using Svelte stores
- Centralized store for theme preferences
- Caching layer for markdown content
- Typed store interfaces

### Error Handling & Monitoring

- Error boundary implementation
- Centralized error logging service
- Performance monitoring integration (e.g., Sentry)
- User behavior analytics
- Structured logging format

## Development Experience

### Documentation

- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Component documentation with Storybook
- API documentation for utilities
- Development guideline documentation
- Contribution guidelines

### Quality Assurance

- Integration tests for critical user flows
- Visual regression testing
- Accessibility testing automation
- Performance testing automation
- Security scanning in CI/CD
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code coverage requirements

### Development Workflow

- Conventional commits
- Semantic versioning
- Automated changelog generation
- Pull request templates
- Issue templates
- Branch protection rules

## Operations

### Deployment

- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Automated rollback procedures
- Feature flags implementation
